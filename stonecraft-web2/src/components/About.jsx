          ​ For over 15 years, musical duo, Stonecraft, has been captivating
          audiences with a combination of acoustic guitar melodies and
          traditional Celtic instruments and sounds. Stonecraft was created by
          Andy Morgan and Viil Hov Fjøse. Morgan is a Welshman and vocalist who
          plays the bouzouki, cittern, mandolin, and guitar. Together, the pair
          has recorded and released four critically acclaimed albums. Secret
          Window fits snugly into the tapestry of Stonecraft’s works over the
          years while reinforcing the band’s uniqueness within the British folk
          genre. Often described as spine-tingling, rhythmic, and enchanting,
          Stonecraft brings their audiences into a new world where they will
          become entrapped by the otherworldly instruments and blissful
          harmonies. The cover artwork for Secret Window was designed by the
          American artist and author Doug Cushman, who helps bring the song to
          life in his own way.
